This layer monitors, controls, and detects all activities related to credentials and privileged accounts. Since privileged accounts are integral to every IT infrastructure and are frequently the target in advanced cyberattacks, safeguarding them is crucial. Attackers, once they infiltrate a system, require these credentials to navigate and access valuable data. CyberArk provides users with the means to exert control over these credentials, securing the privileged accounts and enhancing the overall cybersecurity posture.</p></div><div><h2 data-heading="What is a Privileged Account?" id="What_is_a_Privileged_Account?" style="display: flex;"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>What is a Privileged Account?</h2></div><div><p>A privileged account is a user account that possesses greater permissions compared to regular users.

<li data-line="0">
<p><strong>Local account</strong>: This type of account controls access to a single, physical computer. The credentials (username, password, and SID/UID) for a local account are stored on the computer's hard drive. When someone logs in using a local account, the computer validates the login by checking its own stored credentials. Essentially, a local account grants a user a certain level of access to that individual computer.</p>
</li>
<li data-line="2">
<p><strong>Domain account</strong>: A domain account refers to a user whose credentials are stored on a domain controller instead of the computer they are accessing. When logging in as a domain user, the computer queries the domain controller to determine the privileges granted to that user.</p>
</li>
<li data-line="4">
<p><strong>Service account</strong>: Service accounts are specialized user accounts used by applications or services to interact with the operating system. These accounts allow services to make changes to the OS or its configuration. By assigning specific permissions, one can regulate the actions a service can execute using the service account.</p>
</li>
<li data-line="6">
<p><strong>Shared account</strong>: Shared accounts utilize a single set of credentials to authenticate multiple users. This type of account can present challenges for IT because it can be difficult to track individual activity and ensure visibility. The foundation of identity and access management (IAM) is knowing which user accessed which resource, a task that becomes complex with shared accounts.</p>
</li>
</ol></div><div><h2 data-heading="What is Identity and Access Management (IAM)?" id="What_is_Identity_and_Access_Management_(IAM)?" style="display: flex;"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>What is Identity and Access Management (IAM)?</h2></div><div><p>Identity and access management (IAM) refers to the security discipline that manages and ensures the appropriate access of users to technology resources. It encompasses both the process of defining and controlling user roles and their respective access privileges, as well as the circumstances under which these privileges are granted or denied. Here's a breakdown:</p></div><div><ul class="has-list-bullet">
<li data-line="0"><div class="list-bullet"></div><strong>Authentication</strong>: IAM systems authenticate users, verifying their identity. Once a user's identity is successfully authenticated, the IAM system then determines their authorization levels to ensure they can perform the requested activity.
</li>
<li data-line="2"><div class="list-bullet"></div><strong>Enterprise IT roles</strong>: IAM not only applies to employees through employee identity management but also to customers via customer identity management.
</li>
<li data-line="4"><div class="list-bullet"></div><strong>Digital Identity</strong>: The primary aim of IAM systems is to ensure one distinct digital identity per individual. This identity then serves as the basis for all permissions and rights assigned to that user.
</li>
<li data-line="6"><div class="list-bullet"></div><strong>Access Lifecycle</strong>: After establishing a digital identity, it needs continuous management. This includes monitoring, updating, and adjusting access rights throughout the user's association with the organization.
</li>
</ul></div><div><p>In essence, IAM is the framework that ensures users have the appropriate access to resources, improving security, and enhancing operational efficiency.</p></div><div><h2 data-heading="What is EPV?" id="What_is_EPV?" style="display: flex;"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>What is EPV?</h2></div><div><p>EPV, or Enterprise Password Vault, is a product offered by CyberArk.

These templates ensure consistency across safes, simplify the creation process, and reduce the potential for errors. By using a template, administrators can quickly apply a predefined set of access controls and configurations, without having to manually set each parameter for every new safe. The "SafeTemplate" in CyberArk stores these default values for safes created through the Password Vault Web Access (PVWA). When a new safe is created, it inherits the configurations and permissions set in the template, unless specifically overridden by the administrator.</p></div><div><h2 data-heading="What Are the Fields or Values that Need to Be Mentioned in the CSV Template for CyberArk?" id="What_Are_the_Fields_or_Values_that_Need_to_Be_Mentioned_in_the_CSV_Template_for_CyberArk?" style="display: flex;"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>What Are the Fields or Values that Need to Be Mentioned in the CSV Template for CyberArk?</h2></div><div><p>Answer: For onboarding accounts to CyberArk using a CSV template, the following fields are commonly required:</p></div><div><ul class="has-list-bullet">

<p><strong>User Request Creation:</strong> In a system where the Master Policy enforces Dual Control, a user desiring account access must initiate a request. This request encompasses:</p>
<ul class="has-list-bullet">
<li data-line="2"><div class="list-bullet"></div>The motive for account access.</li>
<li data-line="3"><div class="list-bullet"></div>The frequency of access (once or multiple times).</li>
<li data-line="4"><div class="list-bullet"></div>The specific timeframe for the access. Upon creation, a notification about this request gets forwarded to those authorized to approve it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li data-line="5">
<p><strong>Authorization by Confirmed Users:</strong> The authorized users receive and review the request details via the notification. Depending on the provided information, they can either confirm or decline the request. The necessary number of confirmations is dictated by the Master Policy.</p>
</li>
<li data-line="7">
<p><strong>User Gains Access:</strong> Every time an approval or rejection is given by an authorized user, the initial requester is notified.

The "access safe without confirmation" parameter at the safe level allows a user to bypass the usual procedures and perform tasks directly, even in environments where the dual control password access approval is active. In other words, when a user is granted this privilege, they aren't required to seek any approvals or confirmations and can directly access the safe.</p></div><div><h2 data-heading="What is the Concept of check-in/check-out Exclusive Access?" id="What_is_the_Concept_of_check-in/check-out_Exclusive_Access?" style="display: flex;"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>What is the Concept of check-in/check-out Exclusive Access?</h2></div><div><p>Answer:</p></div><div><p><strong>Check-in/Check-out Exclusive Access:</strong><br>
This feature ensures that only one user at a time has access to a particular privileged account, enhancing security and accountability.</p></div><div><p><strong>Key Aspects:</strong></p></div><div><ol>
<li data-line="0">
<p><strong>Exclusive Locking:</strong> When a user checks out an account, it's locked, preventing other users from retrieving it simultaneously. This guarantees that a single user is accessing the privileged account at any given moment.</p>
</li>
<li data-line="2">
<p><strong>Accountability and Usage:</strong> After utilizing the password, the user checks it back into the Vault. This process ensures exclusive use of the privileged account, offering clear accountability of who accessed the account and when.</p>
</li>
<li data-line="4">
<p><strong>One-Time Password Option:</strong> In addition to the exclusive access, the Master Policy can be configured to permit a one-time password use. Once the user completes their session, the password is required to be checked back into the Vault.</p>
</li>
<li data-line="6">
<p><strong>Automatic Password Rotation:</strong> If organizational policy dictates that a password should only be used once, the Master Policy can be set up to automatically change the password value after its use, ensuring it remains locked and unavailable to other users until its value is altered. This automatic process requires the installation of a Central Password Manager (CPM).<br>

Disaster Recovery (DR) in CyberArk refers to the backup and restoration capabilities to ensure the continuous availability of the system. If the primary CyberArk Vault server fails, the DR Vault server can be brought online to take over its responsibilities. In essence, the DR is a backup server that stands ready to assume operations.</p></div><div><p>Key features of DR in CyberArk:</p></div><div><ol>
<li data-line="0">
<p><strong>Data Replication:</strong> The DR Service replicates external files, which includes Safe files and Safe folders, from the CyberArk Production Vault to the DR Vault. This replication is governed by settings in the Disaster Recovery configuration file, <code>PADR.ini</code>.</p>
</li>
<li data-line="2"><div class="list-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>
<p><strong>Metadata Replication:</strong> The service also replicates metadata files based on two mechanisms:</p>
<ul class="has-list-bullet">
<li data-line="3"><div class="list-bullet"></div>Exports (full backup)</li>
<li data-line="4"><div class="list-bullet"></div>Binary logs (incremental backups)</li>
</ul>
<p>This means that after each action in the Vault, a metadata replication to the DR Vault takes place.</p>
</li>
<li data-line="8">
<p><strong>Syncing Password Objects:</strong> Password objects, being part of the metadata, are always in sync between the production and DR servers. Any change or addition in password objects on the primary server is immediately replicated to the DR server.</p>
</li>
</ol></div><div><p>The above mechanisms ensure that in the event of a system failure or other catastrophic event, CyberArk can quickly recover with minimal disruption to its operations.</p></div><div><h2 data-heading="How Will You Perform a DR Drill in Your Organization?" id="How_Will_You_Perform_a_DR_Drill_in_Your_Organization?" style="display: flex;"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>How Will You Perform a DR Drill in Your Organization?</h2></div><div><p>Answer:<br>
Performing a DR (Disaster Recovery) drill is crucial to ensure that the backup systems and processes work correctly. Here are the steps to conduct a DR drill:</p></div><div><ol>
<li data-line="0">
<p><strong>Backup:</strong> Before initiating the DR drill, take a complete backup of the current Vault server. Ensure that all data has been replicated to the DR server up to the date of the DR drill.</p>
</li>
<li data-line="2"><div class="list-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>
<p><strong>Planning and Communication:</strong></p>
<ul class="has-list-bullet">
<li data-line="3"><div class="list-bullet"></div><strong>Downtime:</strong> Plan and communicate the expected downtime during the DR drill.</li>
<li data-line="4"><div class="list-bullet"></div><strong>Change Freeze:</strong> Ensure no changes or updates are made to the system during the DR drill.</li>
<li data-line="5"><div class="list-bullet"></div><strong>Customer Notification:</strong> Inform customers or internal users about the DR drill activity. Advise them to use the DR PVWA (Password Vault Web Access) during the drill.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li data-line="7">
<p><strong>Initiate the Drill:</strong> Stop the production Vault server to simulate a failure.</p>
</li>
<li data-line="9">
<p><strong>Configuration Check:</strong> Review the <code>PADR.ini</code> file and confirm that the "enable failover mode" is set to "yes."</p>
</li>
<li data-line="11">
<p><strong>DR Activation:</strong> After a pre-defined number of retries (e.g., 5 attempts), the DR Vault server should automatically become active and operational.</p>
</li>
<li data-line="13">
<p><strong>Monitoring:</strong> Keep an eye on the <code>PADR.log</code> for any irregularities and to confirm the successful switch-over to the DR server.</p>
</li>
<li data-line="15">
<p><strong>Validation:</strong> Ensure that all services are running as expected on the DR server and test access through DR PVWA to validate that everything is functioning correctly.</p>
</li>
<li data-line="17">
<p><strong>Revert:</strong> Once the DR drill is complete and validation is successful, you can revert back to the production environment by restarting the production Vault server and ensuring DR is back in standby mode.</p>
</li>
<li data-line="19">
<p><strong>Review and Document:</strong> After the DR drill, conduct a review to identify any gaps or issues faced during the drill. Document lessons learned, and make necessary modifications to your DR plan based on your findings.</p>
</li>
</ol></div><div><p>It's important to remember that the goal of a DR drill is not just to test the technology but also the team's response and coordination during a crisis.</p></div><div><h2 data-heading="What Are the Pre-requisites or Prechecks that Will You Do before while Going for a DR Drill?" id="What_Are_the_Pre-requisites_or_Prechecks_that_Will_You_Do_before_while_Going_for_a_DR_Drill?" style="display: flex;"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>What Are the Pre-requisites or Prechecks that Will You Do before while Going for a DR Drill?</h2></div><div><p>Answer:</p></div><div><ol>
<li data-line="0">
<p><strong>User Authentication:</strong> Ensure that the DR user is enabled and that the password is set and verified.</p>
</li>

<p><strong>Client/User Communication:</strong> Notify the clients or internal users about the DR drill and inform them of the expected downtime. Ensure they are aware of the change freeze period and its duration.</p>
</li>
<li data-line="4">
<p><strong>DR Server Configuration:</strong> Confirm that the DR server is correctly pointed to the primary Vault and all other component servers, with the exception of CPM (Central Password Manager).</p>
</li>
<li data-line="6">
<p><strong>Data Integrity Check:</strong> Ensure that all data has been successfully replicated to the DR server and that there is no data discrepancy between the primary and DR servers.</p>
</li>
<li data-line="8">
<p><strong>Network Check:</strong> Verify that the DR server can communicate without issues with all related infrastructure components. </p>
</li>
<li data-line="10">
<p><strong>Backup:</strong> Before starting the drill, take a comprehensive backup of the primary Vault server.</p>
</li>
<li data-line="12">
<p><strong>System Health Check:</strong> Ensure that both the primary Vault server and the DR server are healthy and that there are no underlying issues that might affect the DR drill.</p>
</li>
<li data-line="14">
<p><strong>Documentation:</strong> Have all relevant documentation, such as DR procedures, contact lists, and system configurations, readily available.</p>
</li>
<li data-line="16">
<p><strong>Test Access:</strong> Before initiating the DR drill, test access to all systems and applications through the DR environment to ensure smooth operation once the drill begins.</p>
</li>
<li data-line="18">
<p><strong>Rollback Plan:</strong> Always have a rollback plan in place. In case the DR drill does not go as expected, you should have a clear and defined method to revert to the primary environment without any data loss or extended downtime.</p>
</li>
<li data-line="20">
<p><strong>Team Availability:</strong> Ensure that all key personnel, including system administrators, network engineers, and other essential staff, are available and informed about the DR drill's schedule and their roles.</p>
